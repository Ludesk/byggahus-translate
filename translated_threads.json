        "message": "Hej,\n\n\nJag har lite funderingar över hur en power inverter fungerar [URL]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_inverter[/URL]. Jag råkar ha två sådana liggande och blev förvånad över hur uttaget fungerade, troligtvis för att jag är van med svenska uttag. Detta är amerikanska modeller för husbilar. Detta är ju inte så relaterat till husel men frågar här för jag vet att det finns många kunniga personer som läser i detta forum.\n\n\nDet verkar inte finnas någon neutral i ett sådant uttag, utan mer två faser och en jord. Det är ca 50 V mellan varje uttagshål och  jord, sedan är det 120V mellan uttagshålen (vet inte hur nogrann min voltmeter är). Kan man tänka sig att uttaget fyller ungefär samma funktion som detta elkraftsystem [URL]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-phase_electric_power[/URL] och att man kör alla laster mellan faserna (borde ju varit 60 V mellan jord-fas då)? Skulle man kunna köra 50V laster mellan fas-jord i en sådan (dvs i ett system utan jord)? Går det att koppla ihop jorden på dem för att få en gemensam neutral punkt?\n\n\nVad är det egentligen som avgör spänningen när man mäter mellan ena fasen på den ena och ena fasen på den andra? Detta är ju såklart potentialskillnaden men kan fasförskjutningen bidra till att den kan variera mellan 0 V och 120 V eller är det något annat intervall här (brukar få runt 50-90 V)?\n\nMina frågor är bara till för att öka min förståelse, inte för några praktiska tillämpningar.",

This isn't so related to house wiring but I'm asking here because I know there are many knowledgeable people who read this forum.\n\n\nIt seems that there is no neutral in such an outlet, but rather two phases and a ground.

Denna kommentar tolkar jag som att invertern borde fungera som att det skulle gå att summera spänningarna precis som i ett split-phase system (180 grader förskjutning mellan faserna).

Det är mycket möjligt att min voltmeter är dålig men jag får dock 120 V mellan faserna (vilket tyder på att den borde fungera någorlunda).\n\n[QUOTE]\nMenar du med din sista fråga att du mäter spänningen mellan två olika inverters? Det borde inte ge något mätvärde alls - i alla fall ingen ström.\n[/QUOTE]\n\nJapp, jag menar att jag mäter mellan en fas på den ena och en fas på den andra. Varför borde inte det ge något mätvärde? Ända gången det borde ge 0 V är väll om man råkar starta upp båda inverters så sinuskurvorna ligger i fas. Detta känns ganska osannolikt. Känns ju som att om invertern fungerar som ett split-phase system så borde det bli 0 V om de är helt i fas och 120 V om man startar upp dem helt ur fas (180 grader förskjutning). Men mest sannolikt borde det vara att hamna där mellan. Och om man har en spänning så borde de väll gå att få en ström mellan dem?\n\n\nI ett vanligt svenskt elkraftsystem har vi ju alltid den gemensamma referenspunkten \"jorden\".

Jag kan inte förklara spänningsnivåerna du mäter upp. Multimeter borde visa rätt då det är sinusformad spänning. Men vi ska nog som sagt inte hänga upp oss så mycket på denna spänning mellan fas-jord. Spänningen stämmer ju mellan polerna :)\n\nTvå separata inverters ska vara helt isolerade från varandra, närmare bestämt, DC- och AC-sidorna i en inverter ska vara isolerade från varandra, även om vissa (UPS) kan ha en gemensam jord/nolla? Och de är ju dessutom inte synkade med varandra som du nämner så spänningen kommer i så fall att variera, kanske även över tid pga toleranser i frekvensen.\n\nÄven om skyddsjorden på båda invertrarna kopplas ihop, vilket är möjligt, så kvarstår problemet med synkroniseringen.

Googla lite så finns det en hel del att läsa.[/INDENT]\n[/QUOTE]\n\nTack! Detta verkar helt logiskt och förklarar mina mätvärden och jorden.\n\n[QUOTE]\nÄven om skyddsjorden på båda invertrarna kopplas ihop, vilket är möjligt, så kvarstår problemet med synkroniseringen. En liknande frågeställning är vad som händer om man kopplar ihop en pol från varje inverter - får man då ut dubbel spänning? Tror inte det.\n[/QUOTE]\n\nUtveckla gärna detta. Om jag kopplar ihop någon av faserna blir det ju en kortslutning pga potentialskillnaden? Jag förstod inte riktigt heller vad du menade med att det inte borde bli något mätvärden när man mäter mellan olika inverters faser? Tack för ditt svar:)",

        "message": "Hej! \n\nHar haft en tråd tidigare om detta men den kändes inte riktigt aktuell längre så skapar en ny då jag känner att jag behöver få ordning på detta då jag är rädd att rören/kopplingarna ska ta stryk så småningom. Jag bor i en smålandsvilla från 2009 och har problem med att det blir rejäla tryckslag när man stänger av vattnet i kranarna i huset, både på kallvatten och varmvatten, det smäller också rejält när tvättmaskinen fyller på vatten. Smyger man av vattnet så blir det bättre men stänger man av kranen vanligt så smäller/dunkar det i rören. \n\nVi har två toaletter en på nedervåningen och en på övervåningen, den på övervåningen ligger precis över den på nedervåningen så det flesta vatten, avloppsledningar går i samma vägg som är väggen mellan toaletten på nedervåningen och tvättstugan. Det är i denna vägg som smällarna/dunkarna hörs. Är man på nedervåningen så är det mer som en smäll/dunk, men är man på toan uppe så är det mer ett skallarande, som rören inte är fastsatta ordentligt. \n\nI tvättstugan testade jag att byta till en mjukstängande kran och det blev något bättre men inte bra, stänger man normalt kan man fortfarande höra en duns i väggen.\n\nVad fasiken gör man åt detta? Tryckslagsdämpare tänker jag inte fungerar eftersom det är hela huset och både varm och kallavatten. Bifogar lite bilder som jag inte vet om dom gör någon nytta men postar dom ändå. Det ena är en bild på väggen, inkommande vatten, samt luckorna där alla rör går. Det andra hur det ser ut innanför luckan.\n\nTacksam för alla tips!",

I live in a \"smålandsvilla\" from 2009 and have problems with severe water hammer when turning off the taps in the house, both for cold and hot water. It also bangs loudly when the washing machine fills with water. If you turn off the water slowly, it gets better, but if you shut off the tap normally, it bangs/knocks in the pipes.\n\nWe have two toilets, one on the ground floor and one upstairs. The one upstairs is directly above the one downstairs, so most water and drainage pipes go through the same wall, which is the wall between the downstairs toilet and the laundry room. It's in this wall that the bangs/knocks can be heard. If you're downstairs, it's more of a bang/knock, but if you're upstairs in the bathroom, it's more of a rattling, as if the pipes aren't secured properly.\n\nIn the laundry room, I tried replacing the tap with a soft-closing one, and it got slightly better but not good. If you close it normally, you can still hear a thump in the wall.\n\nWhat the heck can be done about this? I don't think a water hammer arrester will work since it's the whole house and both hot and cold water. I'm attaching some pictures that I don't know if they will help, but I'm posting them anyway. One is a picture of the wall, incoming water, and the hatches where all the pipes go. The other is how it looks inside the hatch.\n\nThankful for any tips!",
